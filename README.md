# Implement Iceberg Classifier in Satallite Image using CNN
The purpose of this project is to solve the iceberg classifier challenge and reduce the threat of icebergs to ships in the northern Atlantic Ocean. Expanded the data set using flipping images and tried to use neural network to train the classification model. This neural network includes four convolutional layers, four pooling layers, and two fully connected layers. Tried the influence of different parameters on the model classification results. The final accuracy of this model is 0.898. This result is acceptable because satellite images have low pixels, and ships and icebergs have high similarities. The method to further improve the accuracy is to use the clustering algorithm to classify the data set, or to use other machine learning algorithms to retrain the model.
